# Quick-View Weather

Using Tyler Potts' (https://lnkd.in/gxB8vnK) React weather app guide as the base for this fun little weather app. Tweaked the if/else statement to show a different image for each type of weather based on the city entered. Axios GET requests used to pull data in from the http://openweathermap.org api!
